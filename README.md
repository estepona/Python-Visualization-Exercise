# py-viz
Visualization exercises using Python, primarily with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, also tried `plot.ly` but I don't like their business model.

# Examples
1. Obama Website AB test
2. Million Songs
3. Human Resources Analytics
4. Generation Unemployed_Plotly
5. VirgooTeam Videos Analysis

Each folder contains the data set(s) and a notebook file.
